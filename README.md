# THOA Cookbook Template

Welcome 👋 and thank you for your interest in contributing to the THOA cookbook library!

This repository is the **official starter template** for creating reproducible THOA cookbooks.
Use it as a base to document, share, and publish your own bioinformatics workflows in a clear and structured way.

By contributing a cookbook, you help the community run analyses faster and more reliably — and you’ll earn free THOA platform credits in return.

## What is a THOA Cookbook?

A THOA cookbook is a step-by-step, reproducible guide that explains:

* what a workflow does
* which inputs and parameters it requires
* how to run it
* and how to interpret and share the results

Cookbooks are designed to be **practical**, **reproducible**, and **easy to follow**.

## How to use this template

1. **Create your own copy of this repository**
   Click **“Use this template”** on GitHub or fork the repo.

2. **Rename the project**
   Choose a clear name for your cookbook (e.g. `rnaseq-deseq2-cookbook`).

3. **Edit the content**
   Replace the example text with your own:

   * workflow description
   * inputs & parameters
   * step-by-step instructions
   * outputs & interpretation

4. **Test your workflow**
   Make sure your cookbook can be followed by someone else and produces the same results.

5. **Share it with THOA**
   When you’re ready, contact us at **[hello@thoa.io](mailto:hello@thoa.io)** and we’ll help you publish it.
